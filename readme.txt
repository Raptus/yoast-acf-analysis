Adds the content of all ACF fields to the Yoast SEO score analysis.

== Description ==
[Yoast SEO\'s](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/) score analysis does not take in to account the content of a post\'s [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/). This plugin uses Yoast 3.0\'s plugin system to hook into the analyser in order to add ACF content to the SEO analysis.

This had previously been done by the [WordPress SEO ACF Content Analysis](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-seo-acf-content-analysis/) plugin but that no longer works with Yoast 3.0. Kudos to [ryuheixys](https://profiles.wordpress.org/ryuheixys/), the author of that plugin, for the original idea.
